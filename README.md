\
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

You can use this NextJS template, in conjunction with a plan at [https://www.plan.fanbase.io](https://www.plan.fanbase.io), 
to swap ERC20 tokens on 20+ EVM networks, from your own website. 

With a paid plan at [https://www.plan.fanbase.io](https://www.plan.fanbase.io), you can limit swapping pairs 
to one specific token address, like for distributing only one token from your site.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).



## NextJS Environment

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Next,open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Then, you can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Last, [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
